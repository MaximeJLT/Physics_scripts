# Physics Script

This repository contains several physics simulations implemented in **MATLAB, Python, C, and C++**, covering core topics in statistical and condensed matter physics. Each simulation is assigned to a different language to demonstrate versatility and practical engineering skills in numerical methods.

## 🔬 Simulations included

### 1. 🧲 Monte Carlo Simulation – **2D Ising Model** (Python)
- Simulates ferromagnetic behavior on a 2D lattice using the Metropolis algorithm.
- Visualizes magnetization and critical behavior across temperatures.
- **Why Python?** Ideal for stochastic modeling, data visualization, and quantitative finance (e.g., option pricing, Gibbs sampling).

📁 Folder: `ising_model/python/ising_model.py`

### 2. 🧵 Freely-Jointed Chain – **Polymer Simulation** (C)
- Models a 2D random walk with directional constraints (no immediate reversal).
- Computes distance distributions and diffusion properties.
- **Why C?** Lightweight, fast, and perfectly suited for simple random walk mechanics and efficient memory control.

### 3. 🟢 **Brownian Motion** in 2D (MATLAB)
- Simulates thousands of independent walkers and visualizes their trajectories.
- Calculates probability distributions and mean square displacement over time.
- **Why MATLAB?** Excellent for matrix operations and scientific visualization; ideal for clear plots and quick prototyping.

### 4. 🧱 Cohesive Energy – **Crystal Structure & Potentials** (C++)
- Calculates the Lennard-Jones potential between an atom and a graphene sheet.
- Extracts equilibrium distance and energy profile over surface sites.
- **Why C++?** Best suited for multi-layered numerical computation with structured data and optimization loops. Relevant to R&D and molecular modeling.
